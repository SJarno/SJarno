Former Logistics specialist/foreman looking for opportunities to change career path to software development. On work leave to further my studies with programming.

Been coding for a while, but for a past few years more goal oriented. Studying at open University of Helsinki in Computer Science, and in Helsinki Business College for more in depth Angular + Java development.

- 👀 I’m interested in Python, Java, and web development in general.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on pretty much everything involving Angular, Spring Boot, Java and Python.
